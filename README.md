# Udacity-DLND-FACE

This was the final project in Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree. 
The faces themselves start off looking like a horrow show but do get better over time.

# Examples 

![Faces 1](/images/face1.png?raw=true "Faces")
![Faces 2](/images/face2.png?raw=true)
![Numbers](/images/numbers_fake.png?raw=true "Numbers")
